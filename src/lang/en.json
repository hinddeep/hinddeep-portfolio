    "Hero.heroDescriptions": "I, Hinddeep Purohit, am a budding cybersecurity researcher with publications in top-tier cybersecurity conferences such as USENIX Security. My research interests include telecom network (especially 5G) and software-defined networking security. I have co-authored two patents (provisional as of this writing) with my peers, professors at Concordia University and managers at Ericsson. I have extensive hands-on experience with programming, web and mobile app development (native, hybrid), containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, helm, etc.), cloud environments (AWS, GCP), Linux command line and DevOps. Besides, I am a language aficionado who blogs from time to time on various topics. I aspire to be a polyglot one day with 4 languages including English (C2) and French (B2) already well under my belt. Next up on the list is Spanish.",
